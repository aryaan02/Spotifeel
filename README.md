# Spotifeel

Welcome to Spotifeel! This is a web app created with Python, Flask, and the Spotify API that creates a Spotify playlist for you based on your current mood.
It is as simple as logging into the app with your Spotify account, and then selecting from the general four moods listed on the page: "Happy", "Sad",
"Angry", and "Chill". After your selection, you are prompted to go to your Spotify app, and your new playlist will be waiting for you in your library.
